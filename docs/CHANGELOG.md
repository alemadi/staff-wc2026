## 2026-06-28 — Scoring audit + fix: KO bonus was missing from 5 secondary point displays

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**What:** ran a full scoring audit — extracted the real functions from `index.html` and ran a **61-test suite** covering group (+3 result / +2 exact, 5 max), knockout (winner ladder + independent final-score bonus), the extra-time rule, champion (+25), tiebreakers, and every helper. The **authoritative scorer `scoreFor` (which drives the leaderboard) was correct.** But the knockout exact-score bonus had never been propagated to five *secondary* displays that compute points on their own, so each under-reported KO bonus points versus the leaderboard:

- **`rvVerdict`** (reveal ritual + the day banner *"Today: +N — all settled"*) — counted winner points only; a nailed knockout scoreline didn't show, and the daily total disagreed with the leaderboard. Also made the streak / "perfect day" / "maverick" badges treat a bonus-only KO hit as a miss.
- **`renderDayBanner` potential** (*"up to +N"*) — the KO ceiling omitted the bonus even when a score was entered (group already added its +2).
- **`stakeText`** (the *"+N on the line"* float when you tap a pick) — KO ignored the bonus when a score was armed (group shows *+5 ⚡*).
- **`ppPtsHTML`** (settled per-match points in the head-to-head / profile view) — KO showed *+winner* only; group included the exact bonus.
- **`provFor`** (live provisional pulse) — KO didn't provisionally count the bonus when the live score matched the prediction (group did).

All five now mirror `scoreFor` / the group logic: ladder/winner points **plus** the independent final-score bonus.

**Verified:** 61/61 tests pass against the **extracted real functions** (not reimplementations), including `rvVerdict().pts === scoreFor().pts` and `ppPtsHTML` totals across R32/R16/QF/SF/third/Final, and that the extra-time interim (the 1–1 of a tie that ends 2–1 a.e.t.) scores **0 bonus everywhere**. `node --check` clean.

**DB:** none. Leaderboard standings were already correct (`scoreFor` unchanged) — this aligns the reveal, day banner, stakes float, profile view, and live pulse with them.

**Rollback:** `git revert <this commit>` (frontend-only; no DB/state change).

## 2026-06-28 — Correction: knockout bonus is judged on the **final score** (not "90 or 120, either")

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**Why:** the previous two entries implemented "the bonus hits if your score matches at 90 min **or** after extra time (either one wins)." That was a misread of the intent. The correct rule: there is **one** scoreline that counts per tie — the **final score**. If the tie is decided inside 90 minutes, that's the 90-minute score; if it's **level at 90 and goes to extra time, the after-extra-time score is the one that counts** (the 90-minute draw is just an interim and does **not** win the bonus). Penalties never change the recorded scoreline.

**Net effect on players:** they predict a single **final score**. Example: a tie is 1–1 after 90 min and ends 2–1 after extra time — predicting **2–1 wins**, predicting **1–1 does not** (previously both won — too generous).

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- `koScoreHit(p,r)` simplified to a single-scoreline match against the result's `h/a` (the final score). The "or `h2/a2`" branch is gone. All four call sites (`scoreFor`, `koMatchCard`, `brkTie`, `renderBracket`) were already routed through `koScoreHit`, so they pick up the fix unchanged.
- Organizer editor reverted to **one "Final score" row** per tie (the separate "After ET (120)" row is removed). Note under it: *"Score after extra time if the tie went there · penalties don’t count."* `orgSetKScore` writes only `h/a` and deletes any legacy `h2/a2`.
- New **tiny ⓘ tooltip** (`koInfo()` + `.infodot` CSS): on the knockout pick card it explains *"Final score = the score when the match ends — after extra time if it’s played. Penalties don’t change it,"* with the 1–1→2–1 example. Hover title on desktop, tap-to-toast on mobile.
- Winner pick clarified: *"Pick who goes through — **extra time & penalties decide it**."*
- Copy aligned everywhere: pick-card label is now **"Final score"**; rules/points panel, terms paragraph, and the two FAQ entries all describe the **final score (after extra time; penalties excluded)** with the worked example. Removed all "90 or 120, either wins" wording.

**Data model:** knockout result reverts to a single scoreline `h/a` (now meaning the **final** score, after ET, excl. penalties) alongside `w`. The short-lived `h2/a2` keys are no longer read or written, and `orgSetKScore` strips them on save. No KO results had been entered yet, so there's nothing to migrate.

**Verified:** `koScoreHit` truth table (node) — decided-in-90 and after-ET both match the recorded final score; the 90-min interim of an ET tie now **misses**; pens tie keeps its level final; string scores coerce; winner-only result misses. `node --check` clean. Tooltip HTML well-formed.

**Rollback:** `git revert <this commit>` restores the "either 90 or 120" behavior and the two-field organizer entry. Frontend-only; no DB/state migration.

**Reconciliation:** a parallel session independently landed the same scoring correction (`fde663b`) with a different design — a two-field organizer where `h2/a2` *supersedes* `h/a`, and no tooltip or winner clarification. This commit merges over it and consolidates to the single **"Final score"** field, the **ⓘ tooltip**, and the **"extra time & penalties decide it"** winner note (the approach approved for this session), while **preserving that session's unrelated `watch.html`** live-knockout-fixtures feature. The superseded entry is kept below for history.

**Clarity pass (10-judge layman panel + clickable ⓘ):** ran the player-facing copy past ten roleplayed layman personas (avg 4.3/5, 9/10 understood which score to enter). Two consensus fixes applied: (1) the FAQ now covers the **penalties-only case** — a match still level after extra time and settled on penalties keeps that level score (1–1 on pens → predict 1–1); (2) "if the **tie** is level" → "if the **score** is level" in the FAQ (the word "tie" collided with "draw" for non-native readers). Card sub-line tightened to *"after extra time if it's played; penalties don't count."* Separately, the **ⓘ** was restyled from a faint gray outline (didn't read as tappable) to a **solid gold button with a dark "i"** + press/scale feedback.

**Affordance redesign (10 UX-designer panel):** the solid gold "i" dot still tested as a decorative badge, not a control (panel avg ~1.6/5; 8/10 recommended a labeled pill). Replaced it with a proper **labeled pill button on its own line — "ⓘ How the bonus works ›"** — `<button aria-expanded>` with a chevron that rotates and the pill filling solid gold when open. It now **expands the explanation inline** (a bordered `.help-body` panel — persistent and readable) instead of firing a transient toast. This fixes the figure/ground problem (the dot was lost in the gold-on-gold label row), the touch-tooltip failure, and discoverability in one move. Removed `koInfo`/`.infodot`; added `toggleHelp()` + `.help-chip`/`.help-body` styles.

**Wording — make 90 / 120 min explicit:** the "How the bonus works" panel and the FAQ now spell out the times — *"Final score = the score after **90 min** — or after **extra time (120 min)** if it's played; penalties don't change it"* — so it's unambiguous when the score is read.

## 2026-06-28 — Fix: knockout score bonus is the **final** score, not 90 **or** 120

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**What:** the previous entry made the knockout exact-score bonus hit on the **90-minute score OR the after-extra-time (120-minute) score** — both counted. That was wrong. The bonus is judged on a **single final scoreline**:
- Tie settled inside 90 minutes → the **90-minute** score counts.
- Tie level at 90 and decided in extra time → the **after-ET (120-minute)** score counts, and the 90-minute line **no longer** does.

So for a tie that's 1–1 at 90 and finishes 2–1 in extra time, only **2–1** wins the bonus; 1–1 does not (it stopped being the result the moment the game went to ET).

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- `koScoreHit(p,r)`: was `match(90) || match(120)`. Now it picks one target — if an after-ET score (`h2/a2`) is recorded, the prediction must equal **that**; otherwise it must equal the 90-min score (`h/a`). Still number-coerces both sides so string inputs match. All four call sites (`scoreFor`, `koMatchCard`, `brkTie`, `renderBracket`) inherit the fix unchanged.
- Player pick card: rule line now reads *"Predict the **final** scoreline — the **90-min** score, or the score **after extra time** if the tie is level at 90"*; worked example now reads *"…then 2–1 in extra time → you need **2–1** to win the bonus"*.
- Organizer editor: the "After ET (120)" hint now reads *"only if ET — replaces 90-min for the bonus"*.
- Rules/points panel + both FAQ answers ("How do points work?", "Knockouts — how does the score bonus work?") reworded from "matches at 90 **or** after extra time" to the final-score rule, with the example spelling out that 1–1 stops counting once the tie goes to ET.

**Data model:** unchanged. Knockout results still carry `h/a` (90 min), optional `h2/a2` (after ET), and `w` (winner). Only the interpretation changed: `h2/a2`, when present, now *supersedes* `h/a` for the bonus instead of being an additional way to win.

**Verified:** `koScoreHit` truth table re-checked — for `{h:1,a:1,h2:2,a2:1}` only pred 2–1 hits (1–1 and 0–0 miss); for a 90-only result `{h:2,a:0}` pred 2–0 hits; empty/partial preds miss; string scores coerce. `node --check` on the extracted script clean. Group scoring paths untouched.

**DB:** none.

**Rollback:** `git revert <this commit>` (frontend-only; no DB/state migration).

## 2026-06-28 — Feature: knockout exact-score bonus hits on 90 **or** 120 min

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**What:** the knockout exact-score bonus was judged on the **90-minute scoreline only**. It now hits if a player's predicted score matches the **90-minute score OR the after-extra-time (120-minute) score**. Players still enter a single predicted score; matching either recorded scoreline wins the round's bonus. This is fairer for ties that go to extra time: someone who nailed the 90-min result keeps the bonus even if the ET scoreline differs, and someone who predicted the ET result also earns it.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- New `koScoreHit(p,r)` helper: true when the prediction equals the result's `h/a` (90 min) **or** its `h2/a2` (120 min, present only when recorded). Number-coerces the player's score, so string inputs match.
- Routed all four knockout scoreline checks through it: `scoreFor` (leaderboard points + exact count), `koMatchCard` finished card, `brkTie` status line, and `renderBracket` KO tally. Group-match exact checks (`gScorePts`, consensus, reveal) are unchanged.
- Organizer editor (`renderResultsEditor`): added an **"After ET (120)"** score row per tie beside the existing "90-min score" row, writing `h2/a2`. `orgSetKScore` now persists both pairs and clears `h2/a2` when blank; the result record is dropped only when winner and both score pairs are empty.
- Labels: player score field now reads **"90 or 120-min score"**; rules/points panel notes the bonus hits on 90 or 120 min.

**Clarity follow-up (player-facing copy):** the on-card label "90 or 120-min score" read like a choice ("which one do I enter?"). Reworded so players understand they predict **one** scoreline that wins on either:
- Knockout pick card: header is now **"Exact score · +N bonus · optional"** with a plain sub-line — *"Predict one scoreline — it wins the bonus if it matches at **90 min** or **after extra time**"* (the two times highlighted in gold).
- Rules/points panel: knockout header now spells out *"+ optional exact score (matches at 90 min or after extra time)"*; the Round-of-32 row reads *"+4 exact score"* (the per-round detail lives in the header, matching the other rows).
- Terms paragraph already updated to *"the 90-minute or after-extra-time (120-minute) score"*.

**Clarity follow-up #2 (worked example + FAQ):** added a concrete example everywhere the rule is explained, since an example communicates "one guess, two chances" faster than a rule statement:
- Knockout pick card: added a small example line under the rule — *"e.g. 1–1 at 90 min, then 2–1 in extra time → guessing either 1–1 or 2–1 wins"*.
- FAQ (merged in from `main`): the "How do points work?" answer omitted the knockout score bonus entirely — added a sentence covering it. Added a dedicated entry **"Knockouts — how does the score bonus work?"** that walks the 1–1-then-2–1 example and notes the bonus is judged separately from the who-goes-through pick.

**Data model:** knockout results may now carry an optional second scoreline `h2/a2` (after extra time) alongside `h/a` (90 min) and `w` (winner), via the existing `orgSet`/`wc:results` path. Ties decided in 90 leave `h2/a2` empty and behave exactly as before. Predictions are unchanged (still a single `h/a`).

**Verified:** extracted `koScoreHit` truth table (node) — 90-only pred matches/misses; ET result matches on 90 (1–1) and on 120 (2–1) but not 0–0; partial/empty preds miss; string scores coerce. `node --check` on the full extracted script clean. Group scoring paths untouched.

**DB:** none. New `h2/a2` keys ride the existing results JSON.

**Rollback:** `git revert <this commit>` (frontend-only; no DB/state migration). Any `h2/a2` already saved is simply ignored after revert.

## 2026-06-28 11:22 (Doha) — Feature: knockout exact-score bonus (scaled by round)

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**What:** knockouts were winner-only. Added an **optional exact-score bonus** for nailing the **90-minute scoreline**, scaled by round, on top of the who-goes-through points:

| Round | Advance | + Score bonus |
|---|---|---|
| R32 | +4 | +4 |
| R16 | +5 | +5 |
| QF | +6 | +6 |
| SF | +8 | +7 |
| Final | +10 | +8 |
| Third place | +6 | +5 |

The bonus is judged on the **90-minute score** (extra time & penalties ignored) and is **awarded independent of the who-goes-through pick**, so a tie decided on penalties still scores the scoreline cleanly. It's optional — pick who advances as before, then optionally tap a score.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- `KO_BONUS` + `koBonus(m)` constants/helper.
- `scoreFor`: knockout branch adds `koBonus(f)` when predicted `h/a` equals the result's `h/a` (winner points unchanged; the two are independent). Group scoring untouched.
- `koMatchCard`: optional 90-min score input (reusing the group `.scorein`/`.bonus-fields` styling); finished cards show the predicted score and fold the bonus into the points line.
- `bindMatchEvents` + new `koSaveScore(id)`: saves the score to the prediction's `h/a` (winner pick `w` untouched); the group `.scorein` handler guards against the knockout inputs.
- Organizer entry (`renderKnockoutEditor`): a 90-min score row per tie; new `orgSetKScore(id)`; `orgSetKWinner` now **merges** (preserves any score; previously it replaced the result with `{w}`).
- Bracket view tally/status and the rules intro + points table updated.

**Score basis:** 90-minute scoreline (label only; switching to full-time incl. ET is a text change). Robot stays group-only; knockout scores are organizer-entered.

**Verified (VM-sandbox, real functions):** `scoreFor` R32 winner+score 8 / winner-only 4 / score-only 4 / both-wrong 0 / Final 18 / QF 12; group still +3/+2=5. KO card renders `data-ksh/ksa` + bonus label; `koSaveScore` writes `h/a`; `orgSetKWinner` preserves an existing score. `node --check` clean.

**DB:** none. Knockout results may now carry `h/a` alongside `w` via the existing `orgSet` path.

## 2026-06-28 11:09 (Doha) — Knockouts filter: one tap jumps to the current round (▾ still picks any other)

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**Why:** The **Knockouts** filter was a bare `<select>` — tapping it only opened a native picker, so reaching the live round (R32 right now) took two interactions and a scroll. Reported as "knockouts bubble should immediately go to the round."

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- New `curKO()` — the current knockout round = the earliest of R32→Final still holding an unplayed match (falls back to the last KO round once everything's done). Auto-advances to R16/QF/SF/Final as each round completes; no deploy needed.
- `renderFilters` replaces the dropdown-only chip with a **button + caret picker**: the chip reads `Knockouts · R32` and a **single tap jumps straight to that round** (`setFilter`). A small **▾** on the right is a transparent native `<select>` overlay (`.kopick`) covering only the caret zone — tap it to pick any other round. When you're already on a KO round the chip shows that round (e.g. `Knockouts · QF`), highlights gold, and the picker switches you elsewhere.
- New CSS: `.kochip .komain` (caret padding), `.kochip .kopick` (invisible 32px overlay, `font-size:16px` to stop iOS focus-zoom), and the active-state caret colour. Reuses the existing `.rounddd`/`.ddcar` positioning. The old `.chip.ddsel` rules are now unused but left in place (harmless).

**Verified (VM-sandbox, real `curKO` + the rebuilt `renderFilters` KO block copied verbatim):**
- R32 in progress, filter not on a round → chip reads `Knockouts · R32`, button wired to `setFilter('R32')`, not highlighted.
- All 16 R32 finished → `curKO()` advances to **R16**; all rounds finished → **FINAL**.
- Viewing QF → chip reads `Knockouts · QF`, highlighted, tap re-applies QF; the ▾ picker lists all five rounds with live counts.
- `node --check` on the extracted inline script: clean.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

## 2026-06-28 10:51 (Doha) — Arab Teams filter: hide finished matches (live + upcoming only)

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**Why:** With the group stage over, the **Arab Teams** quick-filter was dominated by dead weight — every finished Arab group match (Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, …) still rendered as a receipt card, burying the only thing that view is for: the Arab teams *still in it*. Reported as "remove all the finished matches for the Arab Teams bubbles."

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`): one predicate in `fixturesFor`. The `arab` branch now excludes finished matches:

    if(filter==="arab")return (ARAB.has(v.home.n)||ARAB.has(v.away.n))&&!isFinished(m);

Live and not-yet-kicked-off matches still show (a live match isn't `isFinished`). `isFinished` already covers both group (`!!result`) and knockout (`result.w && koReady`), so finished R32+ Arab ties drop too. No other filter is touched — finished Arab matches remain reachable via **✓ Completed** and **All 104**.

**Verified (VM-sandbox, real functions copied verbatim):** `fixturesFor("arab")` over a mixed set — finished Arab group games (Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Egypt), a finished non-Arab game, a finished Arab R32 tie (Australia–Egypt), an upcoming Arab R32 tie (Netherlands–Morocco), and an upcoming non-Arab tie — returns only the upcoming Arab tie. The `completed` filter still returns all five finished matches (unchanged). `node --check` on the extracted inline script: clean.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback (git):**

## 2026-06-28 10:35 (Doha) — Fix: swipe-to-pick showed blank teams (and saved a placeholder) for knockout ties

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**Why:** the swipe deck rendered straight from the raw fixture (`m.home`/`m.away`), which for knockout ties are placeholder labels ("Runners-up A", "Best 3rd · …") with no flags. Once the Round of 32 opened, swipe cards showed blank/placeholder teams, and `swipeCommit` saved `pickWinner(id, m.home.n)` = a placeholder string that could never match a result. (The Matches feed was unaffected — it already resolves via `fxView`.)

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`): `renderSwipeCard` and `swipeCommit` now resolve teams through `fxView(m)` (→ `koTeams`, the seeded `kteams`) before display and before saving the pick. Group cards are unaffected (`fxView` returns the fixture unchanged). One added `const v=fxView(m)` in each, with `m.home/m.away` → `v.home/v.away`.

**Verified (VM-sandbox, real functions):**
- Swipe card for a seeded R32 tie renders the real teams ("South Africa v Canada"), no placeholder text; `swipeCommit('H')` saves the real team ("South Africa"), not a placeholder.
- Separately confirmed `propagate()` correctly fills R16 from R32 winners (k17 = W(k1) v W(k4), k18 = W(k3) v W(k6)) and preserves the feeder results — no change needed there.
- `node --check` clean.

**DB:** none.

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**Why (organizer-reported "wrong team matches"):** `GROUPS` lettered each group by **order of appearance in the fixtures** (kickoff order) via `String.fromCharCode(65+i)`. FIFA's official A–L draw labelling is **not** in kickoff order, so two groups were mislabelled:
- the group {USA, Australia, Paraguay, Türkiye} is official **D**, but the app called it **C**;
- {Brazil, Morocco, Scotland, Haiti} is official **C**, but the app called it **D**;
- {Spain, Cape Verde, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia} is official **H**, called **G**;
- {Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand} is official **G**, called **H**.
(A, B, E, F, I, J, K, L were already correct.) Confirmed against the official draw — e.g. FIFA placed the hosts Mexico=A, Canada=B, **USA=D**, but the app showed USA in C.

Because the knockout template (`Winners C`, `1D vs 3rd`, `2D v 2G`, `3rd[A/B/C/D/F]`, …) and the third-place allocation table both use **official** letters, applying them to the mislabelled groups fed the **wrong teams** into every tie touching C/D/G/H — both in the Groups tab and the auto-filled bracket.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`): group letters are now derived from each group's **pot-1 seed** (Mexico→A, Canada→B, Brazil→C, USA→D, Germany→E, Netherlands→F, Belgium→G, Spain→H, France→I, Argentina→J, Colombia→K, England→L) instead of appearance order, and `GROUPS` is sorted A→L. One-line construction change in the `GROUPS` IIFE; nothing else touched. `computeGroupTable`, `standingsByLetter`, `autofillR32`, the Bracket view, and the Groups tab all consume the corrected letters automatically.

**Effect on the bracket (now matches the real 2026 R32):** with C/D/G/H corrected, the qualifying-thirds key becomes `BDEFIJKL` (Paraguay's group is now correctly D), and the full R32 resolves to the official matchups — e.g. k2 Brazil–Japan (was USA–Japan), k4 Netherlands–Morocco (was Netherlands–Australia), k9 Belgium–Senegal, k10 USA–Bosnia & H., k11 Spain–Austria (was Belgium–Austria), k14 Australia–Egypt, k15 Argentina–Cape Verde.

**Verified:**
- VM-sandbox: `standingsByLetter()` winners now A=Mexico, B=Switzerland, C=Brazil, D=USA, E=Germany, F=Netherlands, G=Belgium, H=Spain, I=France, J=Argentina, K=Colombia, L=England — matches the official draw fetched from the regulations/draw pages.
- `autofillR32()` against the live standings now yields all 16 R32 ties equal to the **real** 2026 bracket, including the eight third-place ties exactly as published (1A Mexico–3E Ecuador, 1D USA–3B Bosnia, 1E Germany–3D Paraguay, 1G Belgium–3I Senegal, 1I France–3F Sweden, 1B Switzerland–3J Algeria, 1K Colombia–3L Ghana, 1L England–3K DR Congo).
- `node --check` clean.

**Action required after deploy:** the live `wc:kteams` still holds the mislabelled seeding. The organizer must **re-run Auto-fill** once (Me → Organizer tools → Round of 32 → ✨ Auto-fill) to overwrite it with the corrected bracket. No knockout results recorded yet.

**DB:** none by this commit. Corrective `wc:kteams` write happens on the organizer's re-run.

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**Why (real bug, organizer-reported):** The first cut of `autofillR32` placed the eight best third-placed teams with a constrained bipartite *matching* — any assignment that respected each slot's candidate groups. But the official allocation is a fixed 495-row lookup (Annex C of the regulations) that picks **one specific** assignment among the several that are combinatorially valid. For this tournament's qualifying thirds (groups **B, C, E, F, I, J, K, L** — option #95) the heuristic matched a valid-but-wrong permutation: **6 of the 8** third-place ties had the wrong opponent (k8 and k16 happened to coincide with official). Winners, runners-up, the bracket template, and the whole advancement tree were already correct (re-verified below).

**Wrong → right (third-place side):**
- k3 Germany: Bosnia & H. → **Paraguay** (3C)
- k6 France: Paraguay → **Sweden** (3F)
- k7 Mexico: Sweden → **Ecuador** (3E)
- k9 Spain: Ecuador → **Senegal** (3I)
- k10 Brazil: Algeria → **Bosnia & H.** (3B)
- k13 Switzerland: Senegal → **Algeria** (3J)
- k8 England → DR Congo (3K) and k16 Colombia → Ghana (3L) were already right.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- Embedded the **official FIFA 2026 third-place allocation table** — all 495 combinations — as `R3RD` (key = the eight qualifying third-place groups sorted; value = the third drawn by each of slots 1A,1B,1D,1E,1G,1I,1K,1L in order). Parsed directly from the published regulations table (`Template:2026 FIFA World Cup third-place table`); validated that all 495 rows are permutations respecting the candidate sets, and that the table reproduces the page's stated real-tournament row.
- `autofillR32` now looks up `R3RD[qKey]` and maps each slot to its app tie (1A→k7, 1B→k13, 1D→k10, 1E→k3, 1G→k9, 1I→k6, 1K→k16, 1L→k8). The old `matchThirds` heuristic remains only as a defensive fallback (flags ties ⚠) if a key were ever missing — it never is for a valid 8-group set.
- Editor note updated: thirds now placed "per the official FIFA allocation" (no routine ⚠ verify step).

**Caveat:** which eight thirds *qualify* still ranks by Pts, GD, GF, then group letter; FIFA's true final tie-breaks (disciplinary, drawing of lots) aren't modelled, so a dead-heat at the 8th/9th boundary should be confirmed by the organizer.

**Verified:**
- Re-mapped every app knockout id to its official FIFA match number: R32 templates (k1=M73 … k16=M87) and the full `BRACKET` tree (R16/QF/SF/3rd/Final, k17=M90 … k32=M104) match the official structure exactly.
- VM-sandbox run of the real `autofillR32()` against the live standings → all 16 R32 ties now equal the official allocation (k3 Germany–Paraguay, k6 France–Sweden, k7 Mexico–Ecuador, k9 Spain–Senegal, k10 Brazil–Bosnia & H., k13 Switzerland–Algeria, plus the 10 already-correct ties).
- `node --check` clean.

**Action required after deploy:** the live `wc:kteams` still holds the earlier (wrong) seeding from 06:28 UTC. The organizer must **re-run Auto-fill** (Me → Organizer tools → Round of 32 → ✨ Auto-fill) to overwrite it with the corrected bracket — one click. No knockout results were recorded yet, so nothing else is affected.

**DB:** none by this commit. The corrective `wc:kteams` write happens when the organizer re-runs Auto-fill (existing `orgSet` path).

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + `watch.html` + this changelog).

**Why:** The group stage is over, so the filter bar and bottom nav were carrying dead weight (a Qatar quick-filter, a Rounds dropdown still listing the finished group rounds, and a Groups standings tab). Shifted the UI to the knockout phase.

**What changed** (frontend only):
1. **Removed the Qatar filter chip** from the Matches filter bar (`renderFilters`). Arab Teams chip kept; Qatar's matches remain reachable via All/Completed. The `qatar` branch in `fixturesFor` is now unused but left in place (harmless).
2. **Rounds dropdown → knockouts only**, relabelled **"Knockouts"** — the *Group stage* optgroup (MD1/MD2/MD3) is dropped from the dropdown. Group matches still reachable via **All 104** and **Completed**.
3. **Bottom-nav "Groups" → "Bracket"** (both `index.html` and `watch.html`, plus the `#bracket` hash route and `showView` wiring). New **`renderBracket()`** view: a read-only knockout tree R32 → Final built from `koTeams()` (seeded `kteams`), `state.results` winners, and each player's `predictions`. Per tie it shows both teams (winner highlighted + ✓, loser struck through), the player's pick (gold bar + status: "you called it · +N", "you picked X", or "+N on the line" while undecided), and a per-round points header. A summary line tallies the player's knockout points. The **final group tables are preserved** behind a "Final group tables ▾" toggle (`toggleGroupTables` → existing `renderGroups`).

**New functions:** `brkTie`, `renderBracket`, `toggleGroupTables`; new `.brk-*` CSS block. `renderGroups` unchanged (now invoked from the Bracket view's collapsible).

**Verified:**
- `node --check` on the extracted inline script: clean. CSS variables used (`--gold`, `--gold-deep`, `--glass`, `--line`, `--faint`, `--muted`, `--cream`, `--ok`, `--bad`, `--font-d`) all defined.
- VM-sandbox render test of the real `renderBracket()`: empty/no-player state renders all 32 knockout ties (R32 16 · R16 8 · QF 4 · SF 2 · Final 2) with "Awaiting teams"; seeded state (R32 via `autofillR32`, one result, two picks) shows the summary, winner ✓, gold pick marker, "on the line" stake, correct `brk-tag`, and populated group tables.
- Filter bar: Qatar chip gone, dropdown placeholder reads "Knockouts", no "Group stage" optgroup.

**DB:** none. No kv/results/robot changes.

**Commits:** this commit (app `index.html` + this changelog).

**Why:** With all 72 group matches kicked off and recorded (`wc:results` had all 72; `wc:kteams` was empty `[]`), the group stage was correctly locked but the Round of 32 had never been seeded. R32 ties (`k1`–`k16`) have no `BRACKET` auto-fill entry — unlike R16→Final, they must be seeded by hand — so all 16 ties showed placeholder slots ("Runners-up A", "Best 3rd · …") and **no one could predict anything**: group stage over, knockouts not open. Reported as "people cannot predict the group stage."

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- New organizer action **"✨ Auto-fill R32 from final standings"** at the top of the knockout editor (Organizer tools → round = Round of 32). Disabled until all 12 groups have played their 6 matches each.
- Seeding engine reuses the existing `computeGroupTable()` (the same tables the Groups tab shows):
  - **Group winners & runners-up** resolve directly from the standings into their `Winners X` / `Runners-up X` slots — deterministic, no verification needed.
  - **Eight best third-placed teams** are ranked (Pts, GD, GF, then group letter) and matched into the `Best 3rd · …` slots via a constrained bipartite perfect matching (`matchThirds`, most-constrained-slot-first backtracking) that honours each slot's candidate groups.
- Because a given set of qualifying thirds can satisfy more than one valid matching while FIFA's official allocation table fixes a specific one, **every third-placed tie is flagged `⚠ verify 3rd`** in the editor. The organizer reviews and can change any tie with the existing dropdowns before/after. Winners/runners-up are not flagged.
- On confirm: writes `state.kteams` for all 16 ties, persists via `orgSet("wc:kteams", …)` (organizer-authenticated RPC, unchanged), runs `propagate()`, and re-renders — which opens R32 for predictions for all players.
- No change to lock logic (predictions still lock at kickoff, server-clock enforced), scoring, the robot, results, or any player data. Group matches remain locked — by design.

**New functions:** `R32_FLAGGED`, `grpComplete`, `groupStageComplete`, `standingsByLetter`, `r32Spec`, `bestThirds`, `matchThirds`, `autofillR32`; `renderKnockoutEditor` gains the R32 button + per-tie `⚠` flag.

**Verified:**
- `node --check` on the extracted inline script: clean.
- End-to-end in a VM sandbox driving the *real* `autofillR32()` against the live `wc:results` (660 players' tournament): all 16 ties filled, 32 distinct real-nation qualifiers, 8 ties flagged (`k3,k6,k7,k8,k9,k10,k13,k16`), `wc:kteams` persisted with 16 entries.
- Guard: with one group result missing, `groupStageComplete()` is false and the action refuses to write (toast: "Group stage isn't complete …"); button renders disabled.
- The eight winner-vs-third slots (1A,1B,1D,1E,1G,1I,1K,1L) and their candidate sets were cross-checked against the official 2026 Round-of-32 allocation structure.

**DB:** none by this commit. At runtime the organizer's click writes `wc:kteams` (16 R32 ties) through the existing `orgSet` path — the same write the manual editor already performs, one tie at a time.

**Commits:** `8d8802f` (sql/robot.sql + changelog) and a follow-up SHA-correction commit (this one).

**What changed:**
- ESPN's scoreboard names last night's m3 opponent **"Bosnia-Herzegovina"** (hyphen, no "and"), which normalizes to `bosniaherzegovina`. The alias table only had `bosniaandherzegovina`, and the fixture name "Bosnia & H." normalizes to `bosniah`, so `wc_ourname()` returned null and the robot's both-names-or-nothing guard skipped the match every tick. Cron, fetches (all 200 OK), and m1/m2 confirms were healthy throughout.
- Added alias row `('bosniaherzegovina','Bosnia & H.')` to `wc_alias` — applied live in Supabase at 04:51 Doha and mirrored into `sql/robot.sql` here.
- Ran `wc_autoconfirm_tick()` once manually after the insert: it confirmed **m3 = Canada 1–1 Bosnia & H.** from the already-fetched payload (`confirmed 1 · snapshot 2026-06-13→2026-06-13 · next fetch: yes`). No manual `wc:results` write — the robot wrote it through its normal path, organizer supremacy untouched.

## 2026-06-12 19:12 (Doha) — Fix: countdown header jitter (flag imgs rebuilt every second)

**Commits:** `6ceb352` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- `tickCountdown()` runs every 1s. It was rebuilding the whole "Next kickoff" label — the two flag `<img>`s included — on every tick, not just the clock digits. Benign until today's `cca580c` set `.fl-img` to `width:auto;height:13px`: a just-recreated `<img>` has zero width until it decodes, so the header snapped narrower→wider once per second (the visible jitter).
- The match label now re-renders only when its text actually changes (next match rolls over, or KO teams resolve); the day/hr/min/sec digits keep updating every tick as before.
- Side benefit: ~86,400 fewer redundant DOM rebuilds per open tab per day.
- Verified headless (jsdom): the flag `<img>` node is the same across four consecutive ticks; clock still renders all four units; swipe deck smoke test unaffected.

## 2026-06-12 18:43 (Doha) — Swipe deck: score-at-end (removes the blocking +2 interstitial)

**Commits:** `f81f4f4` (app) + this changelog commit. Rebased atop the stats wave (`f54ee51`) after a push race.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; supersedes the swipe +2 step from `e8f2729`):
- Group-match swipes flow straight to the next card — the full-screen "Exact score? +2" step between every swipe is removed (functions, CSS, keyboard guard, `SW.step`), not bypassed.
- The "All caught up" screen becomes a one-tap fine-tune pass when any of the session's group picks still lack an exact score: one row per match with the same score chips; rows mark green when armed; Done closes. Classic done screen when nothing needs scoring.
- Scores save through the existing `chipPick` → `queueSave` path (main-list chips stay in sync); kickoff-locked matches are excluded from the fine-tune list. KO swipes and skip behaviour unchanged.
- Verified headless (jsdom) post-rebase: 70-card deck swiped end-to-end, zero interstitials; fine-tune rows = group picks; chip tap sets score + outcome, `sel` moves on re-tap. Direction chosen by owner from a three-mode interactive feel test.

## 2026-06-12 18:20 — Stats wave: clearer consensus, exact-score lines, finale office stats, champion map

**Commits:** `f54ee51` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; rebased atop the pick-reward layer `8e16fbb`):
- Consensus line rewritten for clarity — it read like betting odds. Now: "🏟 13 colleagues called it: Mexico 31% (you) · Draw 46% · South Africa 23%" — headcount leads, names before percentages, your pick marked "(you)". Knockout cards match.
- Exact-score line beneath it: finished matches show "🎯 You + 2 others nailed 2–1" / "Only you nailed 2–1" / "N colleagues nailed it" / "Nobody nailed 1–1"; locked-but-unplayed matches show "🎯 Top score pick: 1–0 (3)" (shown from 3 picks).
- Reveal finale now ends with up to two office lines: biggest office miss (shown when ≤45% got it right), longest active streak (≥3), perfect-day count.
- Champion card auto-upgrades at champion lock (Thu 18 Jun, 19:00 Doha): the lock-in count becomes "🏆 Office champions: 🇧🇷 Brazil 42% · 🇦🇷 Argentina 33% · 🇫🇷 France 17%" (top 3, flags). Gated on `locked(CHAMP_LOCK)` via the synced server clock — Thursday needs no deploy.
- Aggregation extended inside the same consensus pass: exact-score counts, champion distribution, per-player streaks and perfect days. Still read-only, cached 10 min, locked-matches-only, hidden in demo.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL.

**Rollback:** `git revert f54ee51 && git push origin main` — pure frontend.

## 2026-06-12 17:55 (Doha) — PIN prompt: close the deck, keep pre-PIN picks, welcome-back prefill

**Commits:** `26236f0` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; applies atop UX wave 1 `e8f2729`):
- `needPin()` now closes the swipe deck (if open) before `go("join")`. The PIN re-prompt — which every device hits once after Anti-cheat Phase 1 — used to fire behind the overlay, leaving players swiping picks that never saved.
- `needPin()` prefills the handle and dispatches `input` so the welcome-back flow fires (note + "Resume my game"), plus instant name/dept/country prefill from the live session — the forced re-claim is one field, and dept/country aren't blanked or reset to Qatar.
- `joinNow()` merges in-memory predictions (+ champ) over the server copy when re-claiming the active session's own slug, so picks made before entering the PIN are no longer dropped. Never merges when claiming a different handle; kickoff locks remain server-enforced.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

## 2026-06-12 17:41 — UX wave 1: link cards, slim sticky bar, office consensus, swipe +2 step, welcome-back

**Commits:** `e8f2729` (app + og.png) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html` + new `og.png`; rebased atop anti-cheat Phase 1 `4f5ed8f`):
- OG/Twitter meta + new `og.png` (1200×630) — shared links now unfurl properly in WhatsApp/Teams.
- Header fits at 390px when signed in (WORLD CUP 26 column hides ≤439px once the user chip shows).
- Sticky progress panel collapses to a slim one-row bar on scroll, seated below the filter chips; the points table auto-closes when it shrinks.
- Swipe mode: each group-match swipe now offers an optional exact-score step that arms the +2 bonus (skippable; arrows skip; KO swipes unchanged). Swipe-card date uses the short format so it no longer wraps.
- Office consensus on locked/finished cards plus a line in the reveal ritual ("Only 23% of the office called this — sharp."). Client-side aggregate of player rows, cached 10 min, displayed for locked matches only, hidden in demo. Future optimisation: robot-written `wc:consensus` key.
- Champion card shows "N colleagues have locked their champion" once N ≥ 10.
- Join: typing an existing handle shows a welcome-back note, prefills dept/country, and the CTA becomes "Resume my game"; department is no longer re-required for returning players (kept from their row). Sign-out copy says "handle", not "email".
- Reveal: the verdict stamp sits below the result text — no more overlap at 390px.
- Leaderboard: viewable signed-out with a join CTA; Matches/Me bounce visitors to join with a toast; the pinned rival is tagged 🎯 in the list.
- Me: new computed badges — 🔥 streak ≥3, 💎 perfect day, 🃏 maverick (won a pick ≤25% of the office shared), 🇶🇦 all-in on Qatar — capped at 5 shown.
- Live-feed guard: ESPN live/finished scores render only once the match is locked by server clock, so picks can never sit open next to a live score.
- A11y: aria-labels on all pick buttons and score inputs; score chips grown to a comfortable tap size.
- MALDIVES departures flaps fit one line at 390px.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL — consensus is read-only `sbulkJSON` over world-readable rows.

**Rollback:** `git revert e8f2729 && git push origin main` — pure frontend + one static asset.

## 2026-06-12 17:05 (Doha) — Anti-cheat Phase 1: APPLIED to production + promoted

**Pushed:** `25b2d13` fast-forwarded onto `main` (from `a98a477`), plus this addendum commit.

**What happened (all times Doha, 12 Jun 2026):**

- **16:57** — full `kv` snapshot taken via Management API *before* any change
  (376 rows; `wc:results` value md5 `086a066c2c97be71ecda0f586c480d30`). Snapshot
  retained off-repo by the operator (contains pre-migration PIN hashes — must
  never enter this public repo). Satisfies the snapshot-before-overwrite rule.
- **16:57** — `sql/protect.sql` exactly as committed in `4f5ed8f` applied to the
  production database in a single atomic batch (Supabase Management API).
- **Verified in-DB:** `wc_locks` = 105 · `wc_auth` = 374 (= player rows) ·
  player rows still carrying `"pin"` = 0 · kv rows = 376 (unchanged) ·
  `wc:results` byte-identical to snapshot · anon privileges on `kv` reduced to
  SELECT only · robot cron `wc-autoconfirm` (*/10) still active.
- **Verified outside-in (publishable key):** `org_check` → 200 `false` ·
  direct `kv` write → `42501 permission denied` · public reads → 200 ·
  `save_picks` reachable and rejecting bad input (`bad_slug`), no write.
- **17:01** — `main` promoted `a98a477..25b2d13`; hardened client confirmed
  live on staffchallenge26.com (cache-busted) at **17:00:47**. Old-client
  write gap: ≈ 3 minutes. Players mid-session on the old client must reload
  once to regain saving.
- **Observed, pre-existing, left as-is:** `kv` already had RLS enabled with
  legacy wide-open policies `r`/`i`/`u`/`d` (PUBLIC) and full anon table grants
  incl. TRUNCATE. Writes are blocked by the privilege revoke regardless;
  the open `i`/`u`/`d` policies are now dead weight. **Follow-up:** add
  `drop policy if exists` for them to `protect.sql` via the normal
  prove-locally-first flow.

**Rollback:** unchanged — see the 16:27 entry below (`git revert 4f5ed8f` +
`sql/rollback.sql`). The operator-held snapshot can additionally restore
`wc:results` (or any key) verbatim if ever needed.

## 2026-06-12 16:27 — Anti-cheat Phase 1: server-side enforcement (RLS + RPCs)

**Commits:** `4f5ed8f` (app + SQL) + this changelog commit.
_(SHA filled at commit time — see "Deploy order" below; nothing is live until the SQL is run in Supabase.)_

**Why:** every rule (pick locks, result entry, identity) was enforced in the
browser only. With the publishable key, anyone could `curl` the kv table to
edit picks after kickoff, forge results, read/overwrite rivals, or delete
entries. Proven end-to-end in `proof/` (all four work pre-change, all blocked
after).

**What changed**

- **`sql/protect.sql`** (new — run once in Supabase, after `robot.sql`):
  - `wc_locks` (105 rows: m1–m72, k1–k32, `_champ`) — when each pick seals,
    generated from the client's own FIXTURES.
  - `wc_auth` (private) — PIN hashes migrated out of player rows; the `pin`
    key is stripped from every `wc:player:*` row.
  - `wc_org_auth` (private) — seeded with the existing shipped organizer hash,
    so the current access code keeps working. Rotate:
    `update wc_org_auth set code_hash = wc_pin_hash('NEW CODE')`.
  - `save_picks(slug,pin,payload)` — the ONLY player write path. Verifies PIN
    in SQL (wrong PIN → 0.3 s nap), keeps the stored value for any match whose
    kickoff has passed (server clock), sanitizes every field, never stores the
    PIN. Returns the canonical row for the client to reconcile.
  - `org_check` / `org_exec` — organizer reads/writes gated by the code in SQL
    (wrong code → 0.4 s nap); writes limited to `wc:results`, `wc:kteams`,
    `wc:player:*`, plus `clearpin`.
  - **The wall:** RLS on `kv` (world-readable, zero direct writes from
    anon/authenticated); auth/locks/robot tables revoked from the API roles.
  - The ESPN robot is unaffected — it runs as the table owner (SECURITY
    DEFINER), so it still confirms group results and still never overwrites the
    organizer. Verified in `proof/30_robot.sql`.
- **`index.html`** (frontend, 85 ins / 32 del): all shared-state writes now go
  through the RPCs. Removed the shipped organizer hash. Device PIN stored
  locally (`wc:pin`); organizer code held in memory only (relocks on reload).
  `persistPlayer`→`savePicksRPC` + `reconcilePicks`; all organizer writes →
  `orgSet`/`orgDel`. No remaining direct writes to shared keys (grep-verified).
- **`sql/rollback.sql`** (new) — exact inverse (see below).
- **`proof/`** (new) — a local Postgres harness that recreates the live shape,
  runs the four cheats before/after, exercises every legit path, and runs the
  robot's two-tick ESPN cycle. `proof/run_all.sh` reproduces it from a clean DB;
  `proof/PROOF_RUN.log` is the captured run.

**DB:** **YES — live change.** Run `sql/protect.sql` once. It is idempotent and
the PIN migration is one-time. **Before running, snapshot the current value of
`wc:results`** (copy the row out of the SQL editor) per project rule.

**Deploy order:** (1) snapshot `wc:results`; (2) run `sql/protect.sql` in
Supabase; (3) push the `index.html` commit. Running the SQL first means the old
client keeps working in the gap (reads are unaffected; the old client's direct
writes simply start failing, which is the point) — but keep the gap short.

**Rollback (exact, executable):**
1. `git revert 4f5ed8f && git push origin main` — restores the old
   client (which reads the PIN from the player row).
2. Run **`sql/rollback.sql`** in Supabase — it restores PIN hashes into the
   player rows, drops the RLS policy, `disable row level security` on `kv`,
   re-grants insert/update/delete on `kv` to anon/authenticated, drops
   `save_picks`/`org_check`/`org_exec`/`wc_pin_hash` and the `wc_auth`/
   `wc_org_auth`/`wc_locks` tables (keeps `server_time()`, which predates this
   push). Round-trip (protect → rollback → protect) verified clean in the proof.
3. If a manual `wc:results` edit was made after hardening, restore the
   pre-change snapshot from step (1) of Deploy order.

## 2026-06-12 12:04 — Swipe discoverability · honest exits · Matches header decluttered

**Commits:** `a576e35` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`):
- Removed the "Where to watch in Doha" row from Matches, plus its 4 orphaned CSS rules. Watch keeps the bottom-nav tab, the live pulsebar, and the footer link.
- Quick-pick entry renamed **"⚡ Swipe to pick · N left"**; dialog aria-label matches.
- First card of every deck open **rocks** (±22px / ±3.4°, 0.4s after deal-in) to show it's draggable; grabbing cancels it; once per open; off under reduced-motion.
- The shared ✕ is now a **42px glass circle, top-right**, in all three overlays (quick-pick, reveal ritual, FAQ); skip moved left; FAQ spacer 34→42px keeps the title centered.
- **Grabber + drag-down-to-close** on all three overlays (`armSheet`): header-scoped, 90px threshold, spring-back under, buttons excluded.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback:** `git revert a576e35 && git push origin main` — pure frontend, nothing else to undo.

## 2026-06-12 18:06 — Uniform-height flags in pick buttons & chips

**Commits:** `cca580c` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html` — 3 CSS lines):
- `.mini .fl-img` (flags inside pick buttons): was width-scaled to 24px with a `vertical-align:-5px` hack, so flags with extreme official ratios looked mismatched (Qatar 24×10 sliver vs Switzerland 24×24 square) and sat below center. Now `height:17px; width:auto; display:block` — uniform height, true proportions, flex-centered.
- `.fl-img` base (inline flags: Qatar filter chip, locked-champion line): same fix at `height:13px; width:auto`.
- `.flag .fl-img` (big team-card flags): unchanged visually, but gained an explicit `height:auto` so the new height-based base rule cannot squash it. `.sw-t .fl-img` (swipe deck) already had its own `height:auto` — untouched.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched.

**Rollback:** `git revert cca580c && git push origin main` — pure frontend, nothing else to undo.


## 2026-06-12 18:17 (Doha) — Pick reward layer: pop+glow, stakes float, completion confetti

**Commits:** `8e16fbb` (app) + this changelog commit.

**What changed** (frontend only, `index.html`; additive, all new JS guarded in try/catch):
- Selected pick pops with a springy scale + expanding gold glow ring (`.pick.pop`). Fires on every choose path: H/D/A taps, knockout winner taps, quick-score chips (`chipPick`), typed scores (`saveScore`).
- A "+N on the line" float rises off the chosen pick showing real stakes: `+3` group outcome, `+5 ⚡` once the exact-score bonus is armed, `koPts(m)` for knockouts (`+4` R32 … `+10` final) via the fixture `kn` flag.
- Completion celebration: confetti burst (gold + tricolor, self-removing canvas) + `#pred-bar` glow + toast "🎉 All picks locked in · N/N". Fires only on the transition `_lastPredC < tot → c === tot` inside `syncProgress()` — no retro-fire on boot for already-complete players; re-arms whenever `predTotal()` grows (new KO round unlocking).
- Haptics deliberately unchanged (`vibrate(8)` as-is — stronger haptics considered and declined). `prefers-reduced-motion` respected: CSS via the existing global override, confetti via a JS matchMedia gate.

**DB:** none. No kv writes, no SQL, `wc:results` untouched. **kv snapshot:** n/a — no kv overwrite.

**Pushed:** 188bed0 (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** Exact-score chips on match cards now follow the result pick (outcome-keyed sets, same as the swipe fine-tune pass) with a 3-chip starter set before a result is chosen. Switching result clears a contradictory stored score (toast shown); complete custom scores always derive the result; `syncChips` removed in favor of `rerenderChips`. No DB/kv change.

**Changed:** Promoted the staging chip change to production after owner approval and preview testing (rawcdn.githack pinned to edb82f4). Exact-score chips now follow the result pick; contradictory stored scores are cleared on result switch; custom scores derive the result. Frontend only — no DB/kv change, robot untouched.

**Pushed:** 37352ed (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** Player avatars switched from the uniform beige monogram to deterministic Komposition badges — one circle, one rotated bar, one gold accent dot, generated from the name/slug with the initial overlaid. Applied centrally to all five avatar sites (leaderboard rows, podium, profile, top chip, rival watch) via a new `avatarFill(name)` helper; `.avatar` CSS now hosts the SVG behind a light initial. Derived per-name — no kv/DB field added, `standings()` and the robot untouched. Frontend only.

**Pushed:** 7c8a488 (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** The Departments leaderboard now uses a dedicated department badge (new `deptAvatarFill`) instead of the people Komposition badge — a rounded-square plaque (vs the circular people avatar) with a Bauhaus quarter-disc, a three-dot "group" glyph, and the department initials; new `.avatar.deptbadge` CSS gives it the square corners. Deterministic from the department name, same jewel palette. People avatars (leaderboard rows, podium, profile, chip) unchanged. Frontend only — no kv/DB change, robot untouched. Builds on the 20:35 Komposition entry.

**Pushed:** 1c404df (+ this ops commit) — **staging branch only, production main untouched**
**Changed:** Department badges now show a pictogram of the function each department serves (keyword-matched in new `DEPT_ICONS`/`deptIconKey`): Retail Banking → bank, Group Risk → shield, Group Communications → megaphone, Corporate & Institutional Banking → building, Group Human Capital → people, Group Information Technology → chip, Group Treasury → chart, Group Finance → coins, Group Operations → gear, Asset & Wealth Management → gem, Group Compliance → scales; legacy/demo values mapped (Internal Comms → paper plane, VML/agency → bulb, Executive Office → star); Other/unknown → group-of-people fallback. Rounded-square jewel plaque retained; initials removed from dept badges. Supersedes the 20:45 abstract-plaque visual. Frontend only — no kv/DB change, robot untouched.

**Pushed:** 37352ed, 7c8a488, 1c404df (+ staging ops commits 462078f, eb235df, f96f260, + this ops commit) — **to main (production)**
**Changed:** Promoted the avatar overhaul from staging after owner go-ahead. People avatars (leaderboard rows, podium, profile, top chip) are deterministic Komposition badges (circle + bar + gold dot, jewel palette, initial overlaid). Department rows render rounded-square plaques carrying a pictogram of each department's function (bank/shield/megaphone/building/people/chip/chart/coins/gear/gem/scales; legacy values mapped; group-of-people fallback). Frontend only — no kv/DB change, robot untouched.
**§8 gate:** automated headless walk (Playwright/Chromium against the live backend): fresh boot, returning-player boot (real slug, read-only), People↔Departments both directions, demo on/off, Me view, share fallback, rival picker populate — 11/11 passed, zero console errors both sessions. Pick-save and rival-commit not exercised (would write production kv); those code paths are untouched by these commits.

**Pushed:** 6bab9cb (app) + the changelog commit that follows it

**Pushed:** 3dad395, fca6dac
**Changed:** (1) Sticky progress panel: fixed the collapse/expand jitter at the scroll boundary (overflow-anchor:none on #view-matches breaks the scroll-anchoring feedback loop) and made the mini transition smooth — Swipe-to-pick button and panel now animate width/padding/font/radius over .18s; observer guarded against redundant toggles. (2) Champion pick lifecycle: full card only while unpicked; collapses to a slim tap-to-change chip once picked; after the 18 Jun lock it leaves the Matches feed (trophy+flag token in the sticky bar links to Me, new champion line on the Me card, +25 nudge for players with no pick); payoff banner returns to Matches after the final. ?champlock URL param previews the locked state.
