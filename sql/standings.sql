-- MATCHDAY · standings() RPC — server-side leaderboard (slim payload)
-- Paste this whole file into the Supabase SQL editor and click Run.
-- Safe to re-run any time (CREATE OR REPLACE) — no DROP, signature unchanged,
-- grant re-applied at the bottom. Run AFTER sql/robot.sql (needs wc_ko_teams)
-- and sql/protect.sql (chips are validated + lock-guarded in save_picks there).
--
-- Scoring mirrors scoreFor() in index.html exactly (agreed ladder + exact-score streak):
--   Group (UNCHANGED): +3 correct outcome (requires an outcome pick),
--          +2 exact-score bonus (also gated on the outcome pick).
--   Knockout ADVANCE (who goes through):
--          R32 (k1–k16) +4 · R16 (k17–k24) +5 · QF (k25–k28) +6 ·
--          SF (k29–k30) +8 · third (k31) +6 · final (k32) +10.
--   Knockout EXACT FINAL-score bonus (on top of advance; final score = the
--          scoreline when the match ends, after extra time if played, penalties
--          excluded — matches koScoreHit in index.html):
--          R32 +4 · R16 +5 · QF +6 · SF +7 · third +5 · final +8.
--   Knockout EXACT-SCORE STREAK (knockouts only, going forward): nailing the
--          exact FINAL score in CONSECUTIVE knockout matches the player
--          predicted (chronological order = the numeric part of the k-id)
--          earns, per match in the run:
--          1st in a run +0 · 2nd +5 · 3rd +15 · 4th-and-onward +20 each.
--          Any non-exact predicted knockout match resets the run (but see 🛡).
--   Champion: +25 when wc:results._champ matches the pick — NEVER doubled.
--
-- WAVE B · QUARTER-FINAL POWER-UPS (live from k25; k31 third place: upset only):
--   ⚡ CAPTAIN'S ARMBAND — the player blob may carry optional
--      chips {"qf":"k26","sf":null,"fin":"k32"} (round-range + lock validated by
--      save_picks in sql/protect.sql). When a round's chip names a match, THAT
--      match's knockout earn becomes (advance + exact-bonus) × 2. The chip only
--      MULTIPLIES, it never creates points — a missed armed match doubles zero.
--      Rounds: qf = k25–k28 · sf = k29–k30 · fin = k32 (k31 excluded). Streak
--      bonuses and the champion +25 are NEVER doubled.
--   🛡 STREAK SHIELD — automatic, at most ONCE per player: the FIRST
--      streak-breaking miss with kn>=25 (a predicted, settled, non-exact KO row
--      that immediately follows >=1 exact hit in the engaged sequence) is
--      IGNORED for streak-run computation — the run continues across it. The
--      missed match itself still scores its normal points (or lack thereof).
--   🦅 UPSET BONUS — flat +2 on top when the player's correct winner pick
--      (kn>=25 only, k31 included) was the LOWER-ranked side per wc_rank
--      (higher r = lower ranked). The tie's loser is resolved via
--      wc_ko_teams(results, wc:kteams override) from sql/robot.sql; an
--      unresolved side or missing rank pays nothing. Never doubled by ⚡.
--   PARITY CONTRACT: constants + math tier-for-tier identical to the JS half —
--   PU_FROM_K=25 / PU_UPSET=2 / puRound() / PU_RANK / scoreFor() /
--   koStreakBonus(…,shield) / upsetWin() in index.html. The wc_rank seed below
--   and the PU_RANK const are generated from ONE list — edit them together.
--   Cross-half test vectors: scratchpad wave-b-vectors.json (launch-day proof).
--
-- NOTE: standings() is now SECURITY DEFINER — the upset join reads wc_fixtures /
-- wc_ko_sched / wc_rank, which are RLS-walled from the anon role by
-- sql/protect.sql. Body is a single read-only SELECT; search_path pinned.
