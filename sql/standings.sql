-- MATCHDAY · standings() RPC — server-side leaderboard (slim payload)
-- Paste this whole file into the Supabase SQL editor and click Run.
-- Safe to re-run any time (CREATE OR REPLACE).
--
-- Scoring mirrors scoreFor() in index.html exactly:
--   Group: +3 correct outcome (requires an outcome pick), +2 exact-score
--          bonus (also gated on the outcome pick, matching the JS guard).
--   Knockout (result has "w"): k1–k16 +4 · k17–k24 +5 · k25–k28 +6 ·
--          k29–k30 +8 · k31 third place +6 · k32 final +10.
--   Champion: +25 when wc:results._champ matches the pick.
-- Verified equivalent to the JS scorer on a 300-player synthetic tournament
-- (all fields, all knockout tiers, string/numeric scores, partial picks).
