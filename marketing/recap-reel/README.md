- **Deliverable:** `StaffChallenge26_Recap.mp4` (H.264, 1080×1920, 30 fps, AAC stereo)
- **Reference score:** `score.mp3` (original, synthesized to picture — no licensing)
- **Poster / cover:** `poster.jpg`

## Concept

An "expensive title-sequence" treatment: near-black ink, antique-gold light,
atmospheric haze, slow premium camera pushes. No stock celebration clichés —
every shot is an original keyframe animated with a slow, locked move so it reads
like a graded film, not a template. The brand palette and type match the app
(Anton display, Hanken Grotesk, ink `#050507`, gold `#b49759`/`#e3d3a3`, cream
`#f4eee3`).

## Narrative (7 beats, each landing on a cut)

1. **Hook** — stadium tunnel push → *"It's over. Six weeks · 104 matches"*
2. **Scale** — gold cards burst → *731 players · 40,332 predictions*
3. **The final** — trophy + confetti → *Spain 1–0 Argentina (AET, Ferran Torres) · World champions*
4. **The call** — one lit card among fallen ones → *Only 70 of 731 called Spain*
5. **Standings** — podium beam → *1 Dane · 2 Cemcmldr · 3 AI*
6. **Champion** — Maldives aerial → *Your 2026 champion: Dane → the Maldives*
7. **End card** — Staff Challenge 26 · staffchallenge26.com

## Data provenance

All figures are pulled live from the pool's Supabase, not invented:

- 731 players (`kv` keys `wc:player:*`); 40,332 total predictions submitted.
- Final result + winning scorer from `wc:highlight` (k32, Final).
- 70 of 731 picked Spain as champion (`champ = 'Spain'`).
- Final standings from `wc:ranksnap` (2026-07-20): #1 Dane (Group IT),
  #2 Cemcmldr (Group Compliance), #3 "AI" (Group Communications).
- Prize (Maldives for #1) from the app's own OG copy.

## How it was built (pipeline)

Fully reproducible from `src/`:

1. **Keyframes** — Higgsfield `cinematic_studio_2_5`, 9:16, 2K, six original
   stills (tunnel, card-burst, trophy, lone card, podium, Maldives).
2. **Motion** — Higgsfield `cinematic_studio_3_0` image-to-video, 6s each, slow
   locked pushes with explicit anti-warp direction.
3. **Typography** — `src/cards.html` rendered to transparent 1080×1920 PNG
   overlays via headless Chromium (`src/shoot.mjs`); brand fonts, radial scrims
   for legibility over motion.
4. **Score** — `src/score.py` synthesizes an original cinematic bed (numpy +
   scipy reverb) scored to the exact cut: A-minor drone → relative-major lift on
   the trophy boom (7.0s) → tension pulse → warm C-major resolve, with impacts
   and shimmer on the beats.
5. **Assembly** — `src/build.py` trims/retimes each clip, burns in the faded
   overlays, xfades the beats, applies a unified grade (bloom + warm curves +
   vignette + fine grain), and muxes the score.

### Rebuild

```bash
# needs: ffmpeg, node + playwright-core, python3 (numpy, scipy), brand fonts
node src/shoot.mjs        # render overlay PNGs
python3 src/score.py      # render score.wav
python3 src/build.py       # assemble final mp4
```

Raw 2K keyframes and 6s source clips are intentionally not committed (large and
regenerable); the prompts and job settings live in the generation history.
